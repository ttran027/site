  "summary": "Hi! My name is Thinh Tran. After spending my childhood in Vietnam, I moved to the United States for college in 2011. I completed my first Bachelor Degree in Electrical Engineering Technology from ODU in 2016. I went back a year later for a Bachelor in Computer Science and completed the program in 2020. I'm in love with programming. In my free time, I work on different web projects. One of them is this website, I have developed it with .Net Blazor Webassembly. I originally created it as a profile page, but later added more features that can be used as an mobile app. Feel free to use the codes of the site for your projects. Happy coding!:)",
